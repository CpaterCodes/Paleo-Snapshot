# Paleo Snapshot: a React interface for retrieving Taxonomic records

## Introduction and Rationale

For this project I wanted to build a frontend single page application using React
that consumes JSON responses from the Paleobiology Database API and presents a
number of information points about any genus or species searched by the user.
Full documentation for the API can be found [here](https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/)
and you can find out more about the database itself [here](https://paleobiodb.org/#/).

A number of excellent tools and applications which visualise the database's
records for educational/exploratory purposes already exist, so I primarily
wanted to pursue this project for a number of other reasons:

- To gain practice using React for frontend development.

- To become more comfortable handling complex API requests and asynchronous operations.

- As an expression of a long-standing passion for palaeontology and the natural world.

## User Stories

```
As a User
So that I may feed my curiosity for palaeontological knowledge
I wish to be able to search for genera and species and get a response
[status: pending]
```

```
As a User
So that I may be engaged
I wish to be provided with an image of the genus or species of interest
[status: pending]
```

```
As a User
So that I may be well informed
I wish to be provided with facts on taxonomy, time range, diet, reproduction
and locomotion amongst other aspects
[status: pending]
```

```
As a User
So that I may be provided with a dynamic and elegant experience
I wish to be provided with the ability to alternate between different pages of
information distinguished by theme

```

## Testing options

In the project directory, you can run:

```yarn start``` || ```npm start```

This can be used to run a session of the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for play-testing.

```yarn test```||```npm test```

This will launch the command line test runner which ships with React.
